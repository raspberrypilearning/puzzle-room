## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add in extra sprites to provide more puzzles
- Edit the backdrop and turn areas into new sprites
- Add an extra challenge, by making the player have to complete all the challenges in a set time.

[Here](images/lever.png){:target='_blank'} is a new image that you might like to try using as a sprite, and a [new backdrop](images/upgrade-backdrop.png){:target='_blank'} to go with it. Both are used in the project shown below.
