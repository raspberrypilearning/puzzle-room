## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project.

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add in extra sprites to provide more puzzles
- Edit the backdrop and turn areas into new sprites
- Add an extra challenge, by making the player complete all the challenges in a set time

You could use this [lever image](images/lever.png){:target='_blank'} as a new sprite, and this [new backdrop image](images/upgrade-backdrop.png){:target='_blank'} with the bottom right levers removed to create a new task. Both are used in the project shown below.
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
